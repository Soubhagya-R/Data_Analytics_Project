# Data_Analytics_Project
Exploratory Data Analysis and Advanced Data Analysis project

This project is an extension of the Data Warehouse project.
Here I will be performing Exploratory data analysis(EDA) on the Dimension and fact tables.
Also, I will create SQL-based reports and dashboards for actionable insights into:

- **Customer Behavior**
- **Product Performance**
- **Sales Trends**

These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
